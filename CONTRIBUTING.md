### Local development

You will first need to clone the repository using git and place yourself in its directory:

```shell script
$ git clone git@github.com:timzatko/Sklearn-Nature-Inspired-Search.git
$ cd Sklearn-Nature-Inspired-Search
```

You need to install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#introduction) on your local machine. They execute the following commands within the project directory. Make sure that the tests are passing on your machine. 

```shell script
$ poetry install
$ poetry run pytest tests/
```
